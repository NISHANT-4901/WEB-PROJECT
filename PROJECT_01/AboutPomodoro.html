      <h1>Pomodoro Technique</h1>
      <h3>A Simple Time Management Method</h3>
      <p>
        The Pomodoro Technique is a popular time management strategy designed to
        improve focus and productivity. Developed by Francesco Cirillo in the
        late 1980s, the technique uses a timer to break work into intervals,
        traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These
        intervals are known as "Pomodoros," named after the tomato-shaped
        kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a student.

      <h3>How the Pomodoro Technique Works</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Choose a Task:</strong> Select a task that you want to
          accomplish.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Set a Timer for 25 Minutes:</strong> Start your timer for 25
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Work on the Task:</strong> Focus entirely on the task at hand.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Take a Short Break:</strong> Stop working and take a 5-minute
          break.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Repeat the Cycle:</strong> After four Pomodoros, take a longer
          break.
        </li>
      </ol>
